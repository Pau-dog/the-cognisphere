## Screenshots Needed

To create compelling visual assets, I'll need to:

1. **Take Dashboard Screenshots** - Capture the live running application
2. **Create Architecture Diagrams** - Professional system overview
3. **Design Project Banner** - Eye-catching header image
4. **Generate Feature Graphics** - Highlight key capabilities

Let me start by taking screenshots of the running application and creating visual assets.
