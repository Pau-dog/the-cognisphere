# The Cognisphere: Emergent Intelligence Civilization Engine

A living ecosystem of cognitive agents that evolve language, culture, alliances, and institutions through emergent dynamics.

## What is The Cognisphere?

The Cognisphere is an experimental simulation platform that explores emergent intelligence through multi-agent systems. It creates a digital civilization where hundreds to thousands of cognitive agents interact, learn, and evolve complex social structures without predetermined scripts.

### Key Features

- **Emergent Intelligence**: Agents develop their own strategies and cultural norms through interaction
- **Cultural Evolution**: Myths, slang, social norms, and institutions that persist over time
- **Economic Dynamics**: Trade negotiations, resource management, and market dynamics emerge naturally
- **Social Complexity**: Alliances, betrayals, factions, and trust relationships evolve dynamically
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive network graphs, cultural timelines, and economic indicators

### Applications

- **Research**: Study emergent behavior, cultural evolution, and social network formation
- **Education**: Understand complex systems and agent-based modeling
- **Entertainment**: Watch fascinating civilizations develop and evolve
- **AI Development**: Explore how simple rules lead to complex behaviors

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI + AsyncIO
- **Memory**: Neo4j (graph) + FAISS (vector) databases
- **Visualization**: Cytoscape.js for network graphs
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages + Render.com + Docker
