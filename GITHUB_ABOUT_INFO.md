## Short Description (for GitHub)
Experimental simulation platform exploring emergent intelligence through multi-agent systems. Watch digital civilizations evolve language, culture, and institutions in real-time.

## Long Description
The Cognisphere is an experimental simulation platform that explores emergent intelligence through multi-agent systems. It creates a digital civilization where hundreds to thousands of cognitive agents interact, learn, and evolve complex social structures without predetermined scripts.

Key features include emergent intelligence, cultural evolution, economic dynamics, social complexity, and real-time visualization. Built with React, Python, FastAPI, Neo4j, and modern web technologies.

Perfect for research, education, entertainment, and AI development applications.
